## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Fibonacci Indicator" project aims to provide users with a simple tool for calculating Fibonacci levels, which can be used in technical analysis on financial markets. The application allows for quick and easy calculation of support and resistance levels, helping traders and investors make informed decisions.

### Feature Description:

- **Fibonacci Level Calculation:** Users can input various values, and the app will automatically calculate Fibonacci levels.
- **Interactive Chart:** The app offers the ability to visualize Fibonacci levels on an interactive chart, which helps in analysis.
- **Customization:** Users can adjust the colors and style of the chart according to their preferences.
- **History of Calculations:** The app stores previous calculations, making it easy to access past results.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Fibonacci Level Calculation:** The user can enter values (e.g., maximum and minimum), and the app will calculate Fibonacci levels based on these inputs.
- **Interactive Chart:** The app displays a chart with the calculated Fibonacci levels, allowing for easy visualization.
- **Customization:** Options for changing the chart’s colors and styles to match user preferences.
- **History of Calculations:** The app allows users to view previous calculations and charts.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Calculation Accuracy:** The app should calculate Fibonacci levels with high precision.
- **Performance:** The app should respond quickly to user input.
- **User Interface:** The app should be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing for easy navigation and data entry.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Interface Visuals:

- _Main Page:_ A simple input panel with options to calculate Fibonacci levels and access the history.
- _Chart:_ An interactive chart showing Fibonacci levels with customization options.
- _History of Calculations:_ A list of past calculations, with options to edit or delete them.

### Site Map:

- _Main Page_
  - Input panel
  - Calculation options
  - Calculation history
- _Chart_
  - Fibonacci levels chart
  - Customization options
- _Calculation History_
  - List of previous calculations
  - View, edit, and delete options

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The app stores data related to calculations, including:

- **Input Values:** Information on user-provided values (e.g., maximum and minimum).
- **Calculated Levels:** Stored Fibonacci levels generated by the app.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC model (Model-View-Controller), where:

- **Model:** Manages the logic for calculations and data handling.
- **View:** Displays the user interface, including the chart.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (JavaScript) – if needed for data processing.
- **Database:** SQLite (to store the history of calculations).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for calculation logic, user interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style_: Modular and readable code with comments for better understanding.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Testing:** Check the accuracy of the calculation functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure the components work correctly together.
- **User Interface Testing:** Verify user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess the app's speed under different conditions.

### Testing Procedures:

- Create a set of test cases for each feature of the app.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing detected bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixes, publishing on platforms available to users.
- **Deadlines:** Define planned dates for each stage.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Set up communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user feedback and needs.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Project Phases:** Split the work into specific tasks (e.g., implementing calculation logic, UI, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Set timelines for each phase of the project.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **App Development:** Based on work hours or the development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Server fees, potential external services, and technical support.
